# Assignments: The Pile of Doom

Welcome to the chaotic heap of academic assignments! This repo is a testament to late-night coding, coffee stains, and Jupyter Notebook heroics.

## What’s Here?

- A messy stack of works assigned during academic sessions.
- 100% Jupyter Notebook-powered—because who has time for anything else?

## Survival Tips

1. Bring coffee (mandatory).
2. Expect bugs and bad jokes.
3. Clone at your own risk: `git clone https://github.com/prajwal-069/Assignments.git`.

## Disclaimer

- Organized chaos ahead.

Contribute your own assignment pile—PRs welcome!

Cheers,  
Prajwal, the Pile Master
